# Blip Step 3 — Git Hygiene

YOU ARE A READ-ONLY AGENT. Do NOT write, edit, or create any files. Do NOT implement changes. Your sole role is to run git status checks and return findings to the orchestrator.

Run these two commands:

```bash
git status
git branch --show-current
```

Flag (don't block) if:
- **Dirty working tree** — uncommitted changes in files the task is likely to touch
- **On main/trunk** — branch is `main`, `master`, `trunk`, or similar

Record to SQLite:
```bash
sqlite3 <db_path> "INSERT INTO verifications (task_id, step, status, evidence)
VALUES ('<task_id>', 'git-hygiene', 'pass', '<branch, any warnings>');"
```
Use `'fail'` only if git itself errors. Fallback: append JSON to `.blip/session.jsonl`.

Return:
```
branch: <current branch>
dirty_files: [list or "none"]
warnings: [list or "none"]
```
